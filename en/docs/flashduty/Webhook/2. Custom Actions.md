Configuring incident custom actions allows you to quickly call external interfaces during incident investigation, enabling incident auto-healing, information enrichment, and any other custom operations.

2. Click to add a Custom Action integration

5. Configure Endpoint and custom Headers
6. Save to complete

## III. Use Cases

### Restart Host

When host memory or CPU is maxed out, trigger host restart scripts to quickly complete host restart.

### Information Enrichment

When an incident occurs, callback to your service to retrieve Tracing, Logging, topology and other information based on alert details, actively call FlashDuty Open API to update incident information, such as adding labels or setting custom fields to assist troubleshooting.

### Rollback Changes

When an incident occurs, if determined to be caused by changes, directly trigger callback to your deployment platform to initiate rollback process, accelerating incident recovery.

### Update Status Page

When confirmed that an incident affects online services, trigger external status page updates to promptly notify your customers or upstream/downstream dependencies.

## IV. Common Questions

1. **Is there a response timeout for the service?**

   - The service must respond within 1 second, otherwise it will be considered as a failed response

2. **Trusted IP whitelist for push sources?**
   - 47.94.95.118, 123.56.8.183, 47.94.193.81, 1.13.19.96

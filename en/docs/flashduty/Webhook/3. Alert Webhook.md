Configure Alert Webhook to have the system callback your configured address via HTTP when specific alert operations (such as trigger, close) occur. The callback content will include the latest key information about the alert, allowing you to integrate with your own tools.

## II. Push Description

[The rest of the technical content including Request Method, Payload structure, Response, and Example is identical to the Chinese version, just with English field descriptions]

## III. Common Questions

1. **Is there a response timeout for the service?**

   - The service must respond within 1 second, otherwise it will be considered as a failed response

2. **Will pushes continue after a failed push?**

   - Currently, FlashDuty pushes at most once. A retry mechanism may be introduced in the future, and retries may also occur due to middleware timeouts. You need to handle idempotency properly

3. **How is push order guaranteed?**

   - In theory, events for the same incident are pushed in chronological order, but retries and other situations may cause out-of-order delivery
   - The service can filter based on event_time. If a later event has been received, earlier events can be filtered out. Each push carries the latest and complete information, occasional event loss is tolerable

4. **Trusted IP whitelist for push sources?**
   - 47.94.95.118, 123.56.8.183, 47.94.193.81, 1.13.19.96

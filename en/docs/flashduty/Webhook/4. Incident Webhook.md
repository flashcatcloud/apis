## III. Common Questions

1. **Is there a response timeout for the service?**

   - The service must respond within 1 second, otherwise it will be considered as a failed response

2. **Will pushes continue after a failed push?**

   - Currently, FlashDuty pushes at most once. A retry mechanism may be introduced in the future, and retries may also occur due to middleware timeouts. You need to handle idempotency properly

3. **How is push order guaranteed?**

   - In theory, events for the same incident are pushed in chronological order, but retries and other situations may cause out-of-order delivery
   - The service can filter based on event_time. If a later event has been received, earlier events can be filtered out. Each push carries the latest and complete information, occasional event loss is tolerable

4. **Trusted IP whitelist for push sources?**
   - 47.94.95.118, 123.56.8.183, 47.94.193.81, 1.13.19.96
   - May be updated in the future, please check periodically

Open API is used to access and operate FlashDuty's entity data, such as viewing and managing configurations. Using the API is essentially the same as performing operations through the [FlashDuty Console](https://console.flashcat.cloud) after logging in.

:::tip
If you want to push alerts from your own monitoring system to FlashDuty, please refer to [Quick Start](https://developer-en.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/event-api/alert-event).
:::

### How to Access

#### Request URL
All APIs only accept **HTTPS** protocol access, and there is only one Endpoint:

```js
api.flashcat.cloud
```

#### Headers
Most requests use the POST method and pass parameters using JSON Payload. In this case, don't forget to set the Content-Type header.

```js
Content-Type: application/json
```

#### Character Encoding

All APIs use **UTF-8** encoding.

### Authentication

All Open APIs use APP Key for authentication. You can obtain an APP Key by following these steps:
1. Log in to the FlashDuty Console
2. Go to `Account Settings - APP Key` page, enter a name, and click the add button to complete creation

:::caution
Each APP Key represents an independent user and has all operation permissions of that user. Please store it securely and avoid leakage.
:::

##### Usage Example

Simply pass the APP Key as a query string parameter. If your APP Key is 5e8fbfcdbf14d00696153, the request URL would be:

```js
https://api.flashcat.cloud/path?app_key=5e8fbfcdbf14d00696153
```

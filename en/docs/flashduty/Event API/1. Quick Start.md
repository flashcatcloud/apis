FlashDuty supports receiving two types of data reports to help you integrate data.

#### Alert Events

We already support event integration with most common alert systems, including both open-source and commercial systems, which you can use out of the box. Go to the `Console/Integration Center/Alert Events` page to view detailed documentation and complete the configuration in 5 minutes.

For alert events generated by your own monitoring system, you can push them through our standard API. For detailed documentation, please refer to [Alert Event](https://developer-en.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/event-api/alert-event).

#### Change Events

Based on our experience, over 60% of incidents are caused by changes. Changes are not limited to operations maintenance or new feature introductions - they can also be marketing campaigns. When an incident occurs, being able to view enterprise change information helps quickly identify problems and minimize losses.

We already support synchronizing Jira tickets to FlashDuty out of the box. Other types of changes need to be pushed through our standard API. For detailed documentation, please refer to [Change Event](https://developer-en.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/event-api/change-event).
